instead of getting a SAT image for an AIS ping, i need to do the reverse. the SAT image is rare, AIS is numerous. for a given SAT, find the nearest AIS ping

can calculate acceleration from AIS pings over time (change in velocity)

pointer resolution: pointer is actual novel/hard because you need to 
    1. solve resolution:
        A. make it so small u can run it infinitely (on full res) OR
        B. make it so smart it can point out ships when theyre 1 pixel big (on zoomed out reduced res)
    2. tell you where in the image the ship is (def for B, less for A) either through segmentation or naively outputting image coordinates, so your classifier can zoom in

how is data structured?
    build a big lookup table of
        SAT image path : AIS metadata
    
    prior to training, need to build up directory of all SAT images, along with that lookup with AIS metadata

data augmentation opportunities
    can flip image left/right, and do identical flip on heading (speed/length/type are invariant)
    but no rotations! ships look different at 90 degrees vs 180 degrees. SATs take photos at angle, cant reproduce angular effects 
        (ship has smaller silhoutte facing u than from the side)
    some random pertubation of centering is probably a good idea (even on non-augmented normal data)
        since we're doing some deterministic centering based off predicted location, could introduce some systematic positional effects
        random pertubation of center could help with this, and has zero effect on model as long as we dont clip the ship
    color changes are probably good idea  
        Sentinel-1 data is radar with just one grey channel, but I'm guessing the intensity is kinda arbitrary and depends on specifics of radar
        varying greyscale intensity on image probably makes sense. dont want to overfit on whatever min/max intensity happen to be



call api, basically ask "what tiles did you scan this day?"
    get all tiles. save geometry and datetime
